### Overview
The program is a full-stack web application designed to manage to-do items. It uses React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB Atlas as the database.

## Features

- **Frontend:** React with components for managing and displaying to-do items.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express, providing a RESTful API for managing to-do items.
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas, used for persistent data storage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- MongoDB Atlas cluster set up.
- Postman

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Teju1507/Assignment-ReactandNode.git
   cd Assignment-ReactandNode
   
### Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
npm install http-proxy-middleware

### Start the development server:
cd server
nodemon app.js

### To start the browser:
cd todoapp
npm start
Running the Application
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

### API Endpoints
GET /api/todos - Retrieve all to-do items.
POST /api/todos - Create a new to-do item.
PUT /api/todos/:id - Update an existing to-do item.
DELETE /api/todos/:id - Delete a to-do item.

### Technologies Used
Frontend: React, CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: MongoDB Atlas

### Frontend (React)
## User Interface: The React frontend provides an interface for users to interact with the to-do list. Users can add, view, update, and delete to-do items.
## Components: The frontend is broken down into reusable components, such as:
      ToDo List Component: Displays a list of all to-do items.
      ToDo Item Component: Represents individual to-do items, showing details like task name, description, and priority.
      Form Components: Allow users to add new to-do items or edit existing ones.
### Backend (Node.js with Express)
      API Endpoints: The backend provides a set of RESTful API endpoints for managing to-do items. These include:
            GET /api/todos: Fetches all to-do items from the database.
            POST /api/todos: Adds a new to-do item to the database.
            PUT /api/todos/:id: Updates an existing to-do item by its ID.
            DELETE /api/todos/:id: Deletes a to-do item by its ID.
# Routing: 
          The Express framework handles routing for the API endpoints, processing HTTP requests from the frontend and sending back responses.
# Middleware: 
          The backend uses middleware to handle tasks such as parsing JSON request bodies, handling CORS (if needed), and serving static files.
# Database Interaction: 
          The backend connects to a MongoDB Atlas database using Mongoose (a MongoDB object modeling tool). It performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the to-do items stored in the database.
          Database (MongoDB Atlas)
# Persistent Storage: 
          MongoDB Atlas stores all to-do items persistently. Each to-do item is stored as a document in a MongoDB collection.
# Schema Design: 
          The data model likely includes fields for the task name, description, priority, and other relevant details. Mongoose schemas are used to define the structure of to-do documents.

### Workflow
#User Interaction:
Users interact with the frontend through forms and buttons to manage their to-do items.
When a user submits a form to add or edit a to-do item, a corresponding API call is made to the backend.

## API Requests:
  The React frontend sends HTTP requests to the Express backend, depending on the user action (e.g., adding a new to-do item).
The backend processes these requests, interacts with the MongoDB Atlas database to perform the required operation, and sends back a response.

## Data Management:
The backend retrieves, adds, updates, or deletes to-do items in the MongoDB database.
The frontend updates the UI based on the response from the backend, reflecting the current state of the to-do list.

## Navigation:
The application uses React Router for navigation between different pages (e.g., the homepage, the edit page). For instance, after successfully adding a new to-do item, the user is redirected to the homepage.
## Error Handling
The program includes basic error handling. If an API request fails (e.g., due to a network issue or server error), the application logs the error to the console and may display an error message to the user.

## Development and Deployment
Development Server: Developers can run a local development server for both the frontend and backend. This allows for live reloading and easy testing during development.
Production Build: The frontend can be built into a production-ready bundle using Webpack or a similar tool, which is then served by the Node.js backend.
### Summary
  In summary, this program provides a fully functional to-do list application with a robust backend, a user-friendly frontend, and persistent storage. It enables users to manage their tasks effectively, with features like CRUD 
  operations and keyword search, all while ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
